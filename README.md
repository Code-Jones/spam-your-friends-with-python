## Prerequisites

4. Python Requests
5. Google Chrome (current version 83.0.4103.116)

## Installation

If you get ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] this is a weird mac thing. 
Go to Macintosh HD => Applications => Python3.8 folder double click on Install Certificates.command
