# spam-your-friends-with-python

This is a one day project to create a script that emails a selected friend with terrible dad jokes and pictures of your choice. 

## Prerequisites
1. Python (current version 3.8.1)
2. Selenium for webscraping 
3. Google chrome (current version 83.0.4103.116) 
4. Gmail account with **less secure apps** turned off (highly suggest making a test account for this)

**Important** 
This uses a chromedriver to scrape images. 
Please make sure the driver in the package is the same version as the current chrome browser you are using!
